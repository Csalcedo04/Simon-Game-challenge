# Solution of Simon-Game-challenge proposed by https://www.appbrewery.com.

This challenge was about to use all that knowledge that I learned about the DOM, Javascript and Jquery to create the Simon Game, the game have to start when the player `"keydown"` the letter a no matter if it's upper case or lower case then one of the 4 color buttons play a sound and an animation, so the user have to follow the secuense to pass the levels.
